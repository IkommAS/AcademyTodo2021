## Build Setup locally without Docker

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Setup with Docker

```bash
# The commands below must be run from the root directory of the app (in this case the "Client" folder)

# Option 1: run app attached to terminal window
$ docker-compose up

# Option 2: run docker compose with detached mode(-d) - the app will run in the background on your computer, even though you close the terminal window
$ docker-compose up -d
```
